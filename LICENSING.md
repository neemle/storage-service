# Licensing

This software is made available under multiple licensing options. Your rights to use, modify, distribute, embed, or host the software depend on which license you have obtained and comply with.

A paid license (Commercial, Developer, or Reseller) is effective only if you have received an explicit license grant from the Licensor (for example, in an executed order form, written agreement, or license key issued by the Licensor) and you have paid the applicable fees.

If your intended use is not clearly permitted under the license you currently have, you must obtain a paid license that permits your use.
